# SignBridge-Instant-Sign-Language-Communication
This repository contains the partial implementation of the **Sign Language Translator App**. The app uses **MediaPipe** for hand detection and **TensorFlow** for gesture classification.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe.
- Gesture classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/MehulMathodia/SignBridge-Instant-Sign-Language-Communication.git

## Project Description: Sign Language Translator App
The Sign Language Translator App is an innovative and inclusive solution designed to bridge communication gaps between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. This app leverages cutting-edge technologies like MediaPipe for hand tracking and TensorFlow Lite for gesture classification to provide real-time, accurate translations of sign language gestures into text or speech.

Key Features
Real-Time Gesture Detection:

The app uses a deviceâ€™s camera to detect and track hand gestures in real-time.

It supports two-hand detection, enabling users to perform complex gestures.

Gesture Classification:

A pre-trained machine learning model classifies gestures into corresponding text or speech.

The app supports custom gestures, allowing users to add and train new signs.

User-Friendly Interface:

The app features a clean, intuitive design with visual feedback (e.g., hand landmarks).

It includes a text-to-speech feature to read out the translated text.

Offline Functionality:

The app works offline, making it accessible in areas with limited internet connectivity.

Customization:

Users can switch between different sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL).

The app supports high-contrast themes and large fonts for accessibility.

Technologies Used
Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile app development).

Backend: TensorFlow Lite (for gesture classification) and MediaPipe (for hand tracking).

Storage: Local storage for saving custom gestures and user preferences.

Target Audience
Individuals with Hearing Impairments: To communicate effectively with non-sign language users.

Sign Language Learners: To practice and learn new gestures.

Educators and Organizations: To promote inclusivity and accessibility.

Impact
The Sign Language Translator App promotes inclusivity and accessibility by enabling seamless communication between sign language users and non-sign language users. It empowers individuals with hearing impairments to express themselves confidently and fosters a more inclusive society.

Future Enhancements
Support for multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL, ISL).

Integration with smart glasses for hands-free translation.

Advanced features like sentence-level translation and context-aware gestures.
